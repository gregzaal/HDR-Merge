## Small changes:

- [ ] Dialog to select exe files for required programs
- [ ] Ask to download required programs (Blender, etc.) on first use
- [ ] Remember last used threads and other values in config.json
- [ ] Store exe_paths in config.json
- [ ] Queue/batch processing
- [ ] Update to latest required programs (Blender, etc.) for performance benefits
- [ ] Define range of valid Blender versions, show warning if invalid
- [ ] Better error handling in general, too many bug reports of people saying "it doesn't work" even when the issue is simple

## Big changes: 

- [ ] Replace Blender merging with custom solution that includes deghosting & weighted merging to reduce noise
- [ ] Either expose options for align_image_stack.exe, or replace with [OpenCV implementation](https://github.com/khufkens/align_images/blob/master/align_images.py)
